I chose this sequence of actions because it is easy to insert and then right away screw in the 2 bolts (first starting with the short bolt because it is easier) then I chose to insert the short wire followed by the long wire, simply because making an R with the long wire is harder.

I chose to build the airplane in this order by starting from the back woith the tail wing becuase it only involves inserting the tail wing and 1 screw and completeing all the actions in that section before moving on to the middle then the front. I chose to do the middle second because the actions are more complex than the tail wing but easier than the front propeller.  The middle wing actions involve inserting the wing in the position where the connectors line up and there are 4 bolts to screw in rather than 1.  I chose to start from the back becuase it involves the easiest actions whereas the front involves the building of the propeller which i believe is the hardest part both mentally and physically",Yes,Yes,Yes,Yes,I chose to start from the tail and work my way to the front of the airplane because of the physical and mental effort required for each part.  I chose to start from the tail because it only involved inserting the tail wing and screwing in one bolt which is fairly easy for me and the most familiar.  Then I chose to insert the middle wing because the level of difficulty mentally and physically increased with the addition of inserting the wing with connectors and 4 screws rather than 1.  I chose to end with the front propeller because it was the most difficult and the least familiar to me.  It was relatively difficult both mentally and physically because when building the propeller you have to flip the propeller in order for the bolt and nut to connect and as you add more propeller wings to the propeller the task becomes increasingly more difficult.  When attaching the propeller to the airplane the physical difficulty is making sure to move the airplane front off the table in order for the propeller to fit.  With all of these tasks  I considered the importance of actions by inserting and screwing in the bolts on after another to make sure the parts stay together.,NA,3,7 (Very similar),24613,18978
